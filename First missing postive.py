First Missing Positive Number:

nums = [3, 4, -1, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 0, 6, 5]
output: 9
Note: if every element is in the array from 1 to len(nums), that means we need to return the next missing positive number, which is len(nums)+1  """

"""
simple solution:

1) We first convert the list into a set so that element lookups can be done in O(1) time using hashing.
2) To find the missing positive number, we loop from 1 to n+1:
    * We start from 1 because it is the first positive integer.
    * We go up to n+1 because the second argument in the range() function is exclusive.
3) For each number in this range, we check if it is not in the set:
    * The first number not found in the set is the smallest missing positive integer.
4) If all numbers from 1 to n are present, we return n+1 as the missing number. """

ğŸ§  Logic Explanation: firstMissingPositive (Constant Space)
   â€¢	We know we need to do it in constant space, so we have to play with the input array.
   â€¢	At worst, the array can contain numbers from 1 to n, so we cannot rely on an extra array â€” that would break the space constraint.

âœ… Our Goal
   	* While traversing the array, we want to know which numbers are present and which number is the first missing positive.
   	* We can take advantage of the fact that the array may contain negative numbers.
      Weâ€™ll use the negative sign as an indicator that a number is present.

ğŸ”¹ Step 1: Ignore Irrelevant Numbers

   â€¢	We donâ€™t want numbers that are less than or equal to 0 Or greater than n
   â€¢	So we convert them to n + 1.

   This way, we don't accidentally mark wrong indices in the next step.

ğŸ”¹ Step 2: Use Index as a Marker

   *	We know if a number like 3 is in the array, we should mark index 2 (i.e., 3 - 1) to indicate presence.
   *	So we go to nums[abs(nums[i]) - 1] and make it negative.
   *	But there are two things we need to be careful about:
      1.	We must only do this for numbers â‰¤ n
      2.	We must not flip a number back to positive if itâ€™s already negative
   * So we multiply it like this: 
       nums[abs(nums[i]) - 1] = -1 * abs(nums[abs(nums[i]) - 1])

ğŸ”¹ Step 3: Find the First Missing
   *	Finally, we loop from index 0 to n-1:
      	If we see a positive number, it means i + 1 is the missing number.
   *	If all numbers are marked (i.e., negative),
         it means 1 to n are present, so the missing number is n + 1.

âœ… Why This Works
   â€¢	We never used any extra space â†’ truly constant space
   â€¢	We go through the array three times, so it's O(n) time
   â€¢	We use the input array itself to mark and track the presence of numbers using the negative sign """
